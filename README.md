# React-Native-Exploration
An exploration into React Native

## This project is my first attempt at creating a mobile application with React Native
I have mostly attempted to learn and understand the basic concepts of react native while imporoving my react skills
It started as a basic counter using state, then I added a Pomodoro clock.
Then a Mapped list and a FlatList were added, as well as navigation
I then created a stateful form, with some basic validation and error handling
